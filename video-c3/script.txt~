Boeing's 787 Dreamliner pioneered new frontiers in aircraft design; not
only was it the first airliner to have a carbon fibre fuselage, but
to increase efficiency it also uses electricity for many more
functions than normal, including hydraulic pumps, cabin air pressure,
and the wheel brakes.

All this electricity comes from four generators mounted on the engines,
backed up by a large lithium battery.

The 787's introduction into passenger service didn't go smoothly, as
all 787s were grounded for four months due to the battery having a
tendency to catch fire.  This design flaw was eventually fixed, and
it's not this problem we're interested in.

In 2015, the US Federal Aviation Administration released this
airworthyness directive to 787 operators.  It states that a 787 that
has been powered continuously for 248 days can lose all AC electrical
power.  This is caused by a software counter internal to the
generators overflowing after 248 days of continuous power.

Yes, that's right, the FAA required airlines to reboot their 787s at
least once every 247 days or the generators will stop working.  With
so many electrically powered systems, that would not be good.
