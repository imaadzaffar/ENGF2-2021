# This is my bug report for the bomber game in assignment 2

--

Bug 1:
* Description - Bomb keeps on falling if in a gap
* Cause - The bomb will only explode if it hits a building
* Steps to reproduce - Drop a bomb in the gap between neighboring buildings
* Fix - Explode the bomb if its Y position is >= CANVAS_HEIGHT

Bug 2:
* Description - Buildings not getting destroyed properly and appearing below canvas
* Cause - Building keeps on shrinking if it's hit by the bomb, even if it has a negative height
* Steps to reproduce - Keep on bombing short buildings and then extend the bottom of the canvas
* Fix - If building height is <= 50, make it 0 when shrinking, and also remove it from Display.buildings

Bug 3:
* Description - Too many buildings created
* Cause - The value for CANVAS_WIDTH and the value inside Display.create_buildings() are different
* Steps to reproduce - Start the game and extend the right side of the canvas
* Fix - Change hardcoded value from 1200 to CANVAS_WIDTH, increase CANVAS_WIDTH to 1200

Bug 4:
* Description - Can't bomb the building closest to the right side
* Cause - Plane isn't offset enough to the right when it emerges from that side
* Steps to reproduce - Start the game and wait for the plane to emerge from the right side
* Fix - Offset plane's x position by CANVAS_WIDTH + Plane.width when it comes from the right side

Bug 5:
* Description - Bomb doesn't explode even if it hits the left side of a building
* Cause - The position of the bomb refers to its top left corner, which is not inside the building
* Steps to reproduce - Drop a bomb close the the left side of a building
* Fix - Extend range in check by 10 pixels to allow for the bomb width

Bug 6:
* Description - Bomb is still falling when the game restarts
* Cause - The bomb from the previous game wasn't cleared properly
* Steps to reproduce - Drop a bomb right before restarting the game
* Fix - On restart, explode the bomb to reset its state

Bug 6:
* Description - Restart not working in the middle of a game
* Cause - Program tries to delete text objects that don't exist
* Steps to reproduce - Press the 'r' button in the middle of a game
* Fix - Add a check to only delete the text objects if they exist

Enhancement 1:
* Issue - Text and background color don't show properly for dark mode on MacOS
* Fix - Make bg color white and text fill color black

Enhancement 2:
* Issue - Can drop a bomb even if the front of the plane is off the canvas
* Fix - Don't allow dropping a bomb if the plane's y position < 0

Enhancement 3:
* Issue - Half of the plane goes under the bottom of the screen at the end
* Fix - Move the plane higher up
